# Frontend interview test

## Welcome!
If youâ€™re reading this, it means weâ€™re interested in working with you at Web Summit and solving amazing and difficult problems in shipping our conferences.

This README provides the instructions to a small, self-contained frontend test.

# ðŸš€ Frontend Challenge
This is a quick coding challenge we designed to assess your qualifications as a potential frontend developer. It's important to note that this is by no means a test but rather just a way to get a sense of how you write code and solve problems.

## Getting started
To get started with this challenge: 
1) Create new public repository.
2) Use create-react-app or next-app to kickstart your project

## The Challenge
We'll be looking for **simple, well-designed and tested(only if you have time)** code in the submission.

Please include a ``README.md`` with:
- Setup instructions
- How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution
- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission if you were allocated more time

## Details
Use the [SpaceX Graphql API](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/) and create a project based on this [wireframe](https://bit.ly/2SwvPSP). Use your creativity to choose colors. Feel free to use a library to assist with layouts but ideally you would showcase the methods you would use to create components.

### Routes
#### Dashboard
- List the last 10 missions
- Clicking on the card, goes to the **Mission** route

#### Mission
- Details of the mission (image, mission details, ships, etc...)
- Button to external link

## Required
- React or NextJS
- GraphQL queries(list missions & single mission)

## Desirable(not requires and won't affect final results)
- TypeScript
- NextJS using apollo client
- use React hooks within your code

## Deliverables
We expect this test to take around 4 hours, but not significantly more (your time is very valuable!). We're giving you a week from the date you receive it to complete it and send us your repo URL, using **the technology that you decide, of those mentioned in "required"**. Due to this, we ask that you also provide a `README.md` with instructions for running your project, both api and frontend, along with setup instructions (or provide a Dockerfile and a `docker run` instruction).

### Bonus points
- Your code has tests.

If you come across any questions or anything we didn't cover on this README, feel free to reach out to us and we'll get you an answer as soon as possible.
If you have any question please contact sebastian.white@websummit.com
Happy coding!
